## 👩🏽‍🔬 Hi, I'm Sita 👋🏼 Welcome to my personal website !
I am driven to understand disease biology through molecular and cellular research that can contribute to global health. 

Currently, I am looking for PhD opportunities focused on infectious diseases and host-pathogen interactions.

## 🧠 Research Interests
Molecular parasitology & host–pathogen interactions  

Vector biology and transmission dynamics  

Drug resistance surveillance, mechanism and drug discovery

## 🏠Background
I started out working in hospital laboratories as a certified professional medical laboratory technologist, though my license has since expired. 
Every day, I handled samples from sick patients and noticed patterns. Sometimes I thought, “Hmm, there are a lot of dengue cases this month,” or “It feels like HIV positivity is increasing.” During rotations in the clinical chemistry section, I found myself asking questions like: What led this person to such a critical condition? What risk factors contributed? Why is this enzyme elevated beyond normal?
My curiosity is also personal. Before I worked in the lab, my grandmother passed away suddenly, even though she was otherwise healthy and had her cholesterol and blood glucose under control. She developed severe diarrhea and was hospitalized. I still don’t understand why even the doctors couldn’t anticipate what happened.
Another teacher who shaped my path was my parasitology teacher, Mr. Samidjo, who lived with Plasmodium vivax for over ten years. He often relapsed and spoke about it vividly — it stayed with me.
These experiences led me to pursue a career as a researcher. I want to understand diseases, prevent them, and when it is too late, find science-backed ways to treat them.

## 👩🏽‍🎓Master and Research Career Journey
I decided to pursue a Master’s degree in Infectious Diseases. I was accepted into a program in London, but I chose Université Paris-Saclay instead because the curriculum aligned better with my interests and a scholarship opportunity made it possible. Another key factor was the Pasteur Institute — a research institution carrying Louis Pasteur’s legacy. My Master’s program was partnered with the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia (IPC), which fascinated me. Interestingly, Indonesia also historically had an Institut Pasteur in Bandung, which made the connection feel personal.
During my Master’s, I struggled at first. Most classes were on Zoom because of the pandemic, and I realized I learn best through in-person discussions and shared ideas. That experience taught me something important — I thrive when I can connect with people. Science, for me, is not just intellectual; it’s deeply social.
I also explored other interests while in Paris, including finance and business. I completed my second year (M2) at Sorbonne University entirely in French, fully immersing myself in molecular and cellular studies of infectious diseases. I’m proud to say I made it through!

## ✈️ Cambodia: My First Step Abroad for Research
I had the opportunity to do a research internship at the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia. It was my first time traveling abroad — and only the second time I had ever taken a plane! I’m sincerely grateful to IPC for giving me that opportunity; it made me realize I was truly chasing what I wanted to become.
The people in Phnom Penh were incredibly friendly, and I quickly adapted to the lifestyle. IPC helped with accommodation, which allowed me to focus entirely on my project. My friends and family were worried at first, given reports of Indonesians being scammed into human trafficking in Cambodia — but my experience was completely different, and it became one of the most valuable experiences of my life.
At IPC, I evaluated Plasmodium vivax susceptibility to mefloquine using in vitro assays and genotyping. I learned how challenging it is to cultivate P. vivax and study its full life cycle, especially the hypnozoite stage. I was fascinated by the parasite’s resilience — even under mefloquine treatment, there was decreased susceptibility. I often joked, “Even parasites want to live — maybe we need to think like the parasite.”
This experience sparked my curiosity further. I wanted to study the liver stage and hypnozoites in more depth, which led me to a six-month internship in Paris.

## 🇫🇷 Paris: Where Science Met Culture
I didn’t expect much when I first arrived in Paris, but I quickly fell in love — not just with the city, but with its vibe: the culture, the rhythm, and how science and art coexist effortlessly. The energy is magnetic — contagious.
Navigating French bureaucracy wasn’t easy, especially with barely an A1 level in French. But socially, it went much smoother. I connected with people easily, joining running clubs and yoga sessions, and even making friends with a relative of a prince from Oman. Paris always surprised me.
The Indonesian student community was active and supportive. I’m deeply thankful for them — they made me feel at home, and some friendships have lasted to this day.
Paris constantly amazed me — from spontaneous cultural events to science festivals like Fête de la Science. It was here that I realized science isn’t just a career; it’s a lifestyle built on curiosity, creativity, and community.
I also discovered Station F, the world’s largest startup campus. One evening, I was invited to a friend’s birthday there, and the atmosphere was electric — vibrant, dynamic, and full of creative energy. That night, I felt truly alive.

## 🔬My Lab Projects in Paris
My first project focused on the infusions of Artemisia annua and Artemisia afra. I screened chemical fractions to identify active compounds. Artemisinin, derived from Artemisia, is effective against the blood stage of malaria, but we tested it on the liver stage. I was excited because other plant components might also have antimalarial potential, particularly against the liver stage and hypnozoites.
This work fascinated me. Only a few labs focus on the liver stage of Plasmodium, and it felt like truly advanced research. It sparked my interest in herbal medicine, connecting traditional knowledge with modern science.
Later, I joined a mosquito biology project at the Institut Pasteur. I studied how Plasmodium falciparum survives in Anopheles mosquitoes and explored innovative vector control strategies. I investigated molecular and genetic determinants of mosquito susceptibility and was impressed by their innate immunity — gut microbiota shaped immune responses just like in humans.
The lab was international and vibrant, with seminars that constantly challenged my thinking. I even joined badminton sessions to refresh after work. And yes, the canteen deserves a shoutout — so many delicious options! I gained a few kilos in the first three weeks, and everyone else did too.

## 🇩🇪 Recruited as a PhD Student: From Paris to Giessen
I remember the day I received two PhD offers — one from Lisbon and one from Giessen. I was over the moon, but leaving Paris felt bittersweet. I chose Giessen because of salary considerations, a decision I now regret. Lisbon had a vibrant, international environment, and honestly, I wish I had gone there.
Joining as a PhD student in Germany was a huge challenge. Giessen felt like a completely different world — new culture, new language, new expectations. Some days I felt lost; other days I reminded myself that this is part of research. As a foreigner, bureaucracy was a constant challenge, and I struggled to integrate socially. The isolation led to burnout. My supervisor reminded me it was a trial period — perform better or quit. The message hit hard.
I realized that no matter how passionate I am about science, my health and well-being are non-negotiable. I withdrew after five months. That experience taught me I thrive in supportive, international, and vibrant environments where collaboration and empathy coexist with scientific rigor. Returning to Indonesia, I reflected deeply and reaffirmed my commitment to research with real-world impact.

## 🌱 Founding Awal Sehat Project
In 2023, while searching for PhD opportunities in Europe, I returned to Indonesia and spent time with friends reflecting on life and loss. Many of my friends had lost parents to late-stage illnesses like tumors, kidney failure, or stroke, and I had also lost friends myself.
During this time, I founded PT Awal Sehat. Its main feature is Asli, a digital health startup designed to reduce the risk of chronic and metabolic diseases. Asli encourages healthy lifestyle choices by providing clear, research-backed information on food, sugar, salt, additives, and other ingredients, linked to scientific studies to help people make informed decisions and extend their healthy lifespan.
In addition, Awal Sehat is developing Orchid and Banana, an affordable personal care brand free of harsh chemicals, expanding our mission to promote healthier living in multiple aspects of daily life.


##  🏃🏽‍♀️ Personal Projects  
### 🏅 Half Marathon 2026 Journey
I’ve always been a runner, with pace of 6:30/km but barely breath, recently I’ve approached it scientifically : first tracking heart rate, cardio fitness, pace, and vertical oscillation. 

In this journey I explore discipline, endurance, and the intersection between physical performance and mental focus.


### 📚 Books I Read to Stay Motivated
I’ve been through failures — and ongoing ones too — but these books have helped me stay grounded, reshape my mindset, and stay focused on my goals. Every day, I’m still continuously learning how to improve myself and grow into a better version of who I want to be. 

**Classics**

Napoleon Hill – Think and Grow Rich

**Mindset & Personal Growth**

Russ Harris - The Confidence Gap

Peter Thiel - Zero to One 

Mark Minervini – Think and Trade Like a Champion  (even though it’s about trading, many of the principles apply to life in general for any fields. I like the mindset it builds).
